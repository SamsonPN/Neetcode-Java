    "        * however, the reason why this has minimal impact on the time complexity is b/c we only do this on islands that we haven't seen\n",
    "        * if the entire matrix was a single island, we would have traversed on grid[0][0], saw that it was a '1' and then traversed through it and replacing every cell we encounter with a '0' \n",
    "            - this would basically replace every cell with a '0'\n",
    "            - and we would only need to do this once b/c there are no more islands, '1', to traverse over\n",
    "            - so our for-loop would just keep going without ever doing another dfs/bfs\n",
